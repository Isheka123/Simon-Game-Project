## Description

The Simon Game is a digital version of the classic Simon electronic game. It tests and improves your memory by challenging you to remember an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds. The goal is to reach the highest level possible by successfully repeating the sequence.

## How to Play

1. Begin the game by pressing any key on your keyboard. You'll see the title display "Level 1."

2. Pay close attention to the sequence of colors and sounds played by the game. It starts with one color/sound in the sequence.

3. Your task is to repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons using your mouse.

4. As you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add one more color/sound to it.

5. Keep repeating the sequence accurately. The level will increase with each successful round.

6. If you make a mistake and repeat the sequence incorrectly, you'll hear a "wrong" sound, and the game will end.

7. The title will change to "Game Over, Press Any Key to Restart."

8. To start a new game, simply press any key on your keyboard again.

## Customization
